Q2.1 (3 pts) In which regions are the bad bands located? What are possible reasons for their quality issues?
Answer:
From the first plot you can see the bad bands in 4 regions:
- 385 - 405 nm (3 bands) [315 - 400 nm UV-A]
- 1323 - 1453 nm (15 bands) [Near Infrared / SWIR]
- 1782 - 2018 nm (27 bands) [Middle Infrared / SWIR]
- 2457 - 2497 nm (5 bands) [Middle Infrared / SWIR]

At the boundaries of the sensor's operational spectral range, the signal strength tends to decrease.
This would explain the increased noise in the first three and last five bands; addtionally gases like CO2 or oxygen could absorb radiation.
Another concern is water vapor absorbation, especially in the regions ~1400 and ~1900 nm, which correspond to the bad bands in the data.

Q2.2 (1 pt) What is the original spectral resolution of the data?
Answer:
(2500 nm - 385 nm) / 222 = 9.527 nm

Q2.3 (1 pt) What are the ranges of the returned index values? Which (statistical) distribution do they have?
Answer:
NDRE: 0.1418 - 0.3318 ; REIP: 710.1558 - 719.7072  (Distributions plotted)
NDRE looks like a normal distribution
For REIP, it looks more like some right skewed distribution   

Q2.4: Describe the performance of the two indices as indicators of leaf nitrogen.
 Which one is apparently more suitable? How do you judge their overall performance?
Answer:
There seems to be some positive correlation on the plots, but both are still pretty scattered.
 Both NDRE and REIP reach an R2 score of 0.46 (NDRE 0.4636 , REIP 0.4634).
This gives both indices a moderate positive correlation with leaf nitrogen, meaning they only partially reflect it.
Neither NDRE nor REIP stands out as a clearly stronger indicator here; they lack the strength needed for precise assessments of leaf nitrogen.

Q2.5 (3 pts) Leaf nitrogen was measured as percentage of the leaf dry weight. Is this a suitable metric for
spectral analyses? Suggest some improvements for future data acquisitions and analyses.
Answer:
Measuring leaf nitrogen as a percentage of dry weight works but has its limitations.
Spectral analysis is influenced by factors such as leaf structure/thickness, water content, and chlorophyll concentration.
It is not directly accounted for these variables, particularly leaf area or water content.
This can impact reflectance and reduce the accuracy of predictions from spectral indices (e.g. NDRE and REIP).

Future data acquisitions and analyses could include some of these variables;
e.g. leaf area-based nitrogen content, water content, chlorophyll concentration.

Additionally collecting data across different growth stages (times of the year)
or varied environmental conditions might improve the robustness of nitrogen predictions

Q2.6 (2 pts) How do the degree of the polynom and the window size affect the outcome? Vary the polynom
(e.g. 2nd degree, 4th degree, etc.) and the window size and compare the results. Which differences become
apparent?
Answer:
Higher degree polynomials are more complex, can capture more finer details in the data but tend to overfit, learning and introducing artifacts/noise.
 e.g. three out of four points in a straight line are fitted by p=1 and correctly overlay the fourth, but p=3 misses the fourth completely
Lower degree polynomial might miss finer details but fit the underlying trend and are not prone to overfitting

The window size determines how much neighboring data is considered for each point.
A larger window size smooths the data more, reducing noise/fluctuations but potentially losing finer details.
A smaller window size preserves more local variations, but might not effectively remove noise.

Q2.7 (1 pt) Repeat the comparison of the index values to the leaf nitrogen values. Does the smoothing
change the result? Did the performance of the two indicators improve?
Answer:
Yes, the smoothing changed the results, NDRE improved to R2=0.48 but the R2 of REIP decreased to 0.43 

Q2.8 (2 pts) What is the range of the wavelength position of the 1st order derivative? Compare it to the REIP.
Is this position of the 1st derivative maximum in line with the red edge infection point? If not, how do they
differ in their assessments?
Answer:
REIP2: 712.1339 - 721.2637 1st Derivative: 706 - 719 (Distributions plotted)
It seems like the position/distribution of the 1st derivative maximum/s is shifted around 4nm to the left (lower wavelengths) compared to the REIP.
This suggests that the 1st derivative maximum tends to capture earlier changes in reflectance (where the spectral curve begins to increase significantly).

Q2.9 (6 pts) Implement this work flow in your environment. How do you do it? Which polynom and window
size did you choose and how did you come to this parameterization? Provide a plot of a smoothed and
original pixel spectrum to visualize your results.
Answer:
My implementation is in smoothing_image_data.py. 
I tried different window and polynom sizes and plotted the results for the noisy first band;
p=2 seems to be sufficient, with a window size between 80 and 130 producing good images.
Higher polynomials and lower window sizes introduce more noise, while higher window sizes smooth too much.
